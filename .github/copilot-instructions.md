# Copilot Global Instructions

You are working on a **Next.js 16** project using the **App Router**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **Supabase** as the backend.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16.x (App Router, `src/app/`)
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (utility-first)
- **Backend/DB:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, RLS)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (via GitHub Actions CI/CD)
- **Package Manager:** npm

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Read the docs first.** Next.js 16 has breaking changes. Always check `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before implementing any Next.js API. Heed deprecation notices.
2. **Server Components by default.** Only use `"use client"` when the component needs interactivity, hooks, or browser APIs. Keep Client Components at the leaves of the component tree.
3. **Async APIs.** In Next.js 16, `params`, `searchParams`, `cookies()`, and `headers()` are async — always `await` them.
4. **No local test data.** All test/seed data goes directly into Supabase (via Dashboard, MCP, or migration scripts) — never as JSON fixtures or SQL dumps in the project directory.
5. **Environment variables.** Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix only for variables that must be accessible in the browser. Server-only secrets (e.g. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) must never be prefixed.
6. **Schema awareness.** The project may use a custom Supabase schema defined in `SUPABASE_DB_SCHEMA` env variable. Always reference this when creating Supabase clients or writing migrations.

## Workflow Orchestration

### Planning
- For ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions): use the `@planner` agent first. Do not start coding without a plan.
- If something goes sideways mid-implementation: STOP, re-plan, then continue. Do not keep pushing broken code.
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity. Vague requirements produce vague code.

### Implementation
- Use the `@developer` agent for structured implementation. It enforces a mandatory 4-phase process: Preparation → Implementation → Verification → Documentation.
- Keep changes minimal and focused. Only touch what is necessary for the task.
- After each logical step: check for TypeScript errors before moving on. Fix immediately, do not accumulate errors.
- Read files before editing them. Never guess at structure — explore first.

### Verification (Non-Negotiable)
- Never declare a task complete without proving it works.
- Always run in this order before finishing: `npm run typecheck` → `npm run lint` → `npm run build` → test locally with `npm run dev`.
- Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer approve this?" If not, fix it first.
- Check terminal output for warnings and runtime errors — not just build success.
- **Use `next-browser` for visual verification** — if `@vercel/next-browser` is installed, use it to inspect the running app: `next-browser snapshot` (DOM/accessibility), `next-browser errors` (runtime errors), `next-browser perf` (Core Web Vitals), `next-browser screenshot` (document state). See `.github/skills/next-browser/SKILL.md` for full usage.

### Code Review
- Use the `@reviewer` agent before opening a PR. It runs a structured checklist covering code quality, Next.js 16 compliance, Supabase security, styling, and build checks.
- For bugs: diagnose from logs/errors, resolve the root cause. No temporary patches.

### Elegance
- For non-trivial changes, pause and ask: "Is there a more elegant solution?"
- If a fix feels hacky: implement the clean solution instead.
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — do not over-engineer.

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First.** Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness.** Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact.** Only modify what is necessary. Avoid side effects and unrelated changes.
- **No Over-Engineering.** Do not add features, helpers, or abstractions beyond what was requested.
- **Ask When Unclear.** If requirements are ambiguous, ask rather than guess.

---

## Code Style

- Use `import type { ... }` for type-only imports.
- Prefer named exports over default exports for components (except Next.js route files like `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx` which require default exports).
- Use `@/` import alias for project-internal imports.
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase — do not introduce new libraries or patterns without asking.
